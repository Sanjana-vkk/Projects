Wrangling:
See how percent of population (age) affects voting patterns
Average out population percents in the demographic table (county averaged to represent state)
Drop a column in the voting table (state code)
join table for better comparison
User defined function if statements check in percent

```{r}
demographics <- read.csv(file.choose("demographics.csv"))
voting <- read.csv(file.choose("voting.csv"))



library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

demographics %>%
  filter(!grepl(".", state_abbreviation, ignore.case = TRUE))
```
