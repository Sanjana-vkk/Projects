Wrangling:
See how percent of population (age) affects voting patterns
Average out population percents in the demographic table (county averaged to represent state)
Drop a column in the voting table (state code)
join table for better comparison
User defined function if statements check in percent

```{r}
demographics <- read.csv(file.choose("demographics.csv"))
voting <- read.csv(file.choose("voting.csv"))



library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)


newDem <-demographics %>%
  filter(!grepl(".", state_abbreviation, ignore.case = TRUE))
updated <-select(newDem, c('area_name','PST045214','PST120214','AGE135214','AGE295214','AGE775214'))


finalTable <-
  updated %>%
   left_join(voting, by = c("area_name" ="state"))

FinalTable2 <-
  FindalTable1 %>%
  left_join(raw_data, by = c("location" = "area_name"))



```
